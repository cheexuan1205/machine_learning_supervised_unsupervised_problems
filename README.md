# Machine Learning Supervised and Unsupervised Problems
This machine learning project solved 3 different problems using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. (Principal component analysis, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees (CART))

## 1 Unsupervised Learning Method
The given dataset in this section is the European Working Conditions Survey 2016. This
survey was carried out based on ages and genders as the demographic variables. The
objectives of the analyses in this section are to visualise and discover some underlying
patterns in the dataset. The results and information pertaining to the European working
conditions can be potentially useful for the authorities and agencies in Europe for
implementing necessary actions or enhancements. Unsupervised learning method will be
solely considered in this section, primarily Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

Task:

Visualise and describe the data via unsupervised learning methods.

## 2 Supervised Learning Method for Predicting Student Performance for Mathematics and Portuguese Language (Regression Problem)
Education is playing an extremely important role in a secondary school’s student life. Some
of them like to score high marks and probably there is a group of students who are not that
interested in learning. Here we are told to predict the final scores of students for the subjects
Mathematics and Portuguese Languages as they have a fairly high fail rate. As they also
contribute to the success rate of school’s subjects, we would like to build a regression model
using the variables involved to better understand the variables and factors that affect student
performance in both of these subjects. The final predicted results collected will then benefit
decision makers to improve on the quality of education in the two schools, Gabriel Pereira
and Mousinho da Silveira.

Task:

Build a regression model for the variable  G3 (final grade) without using the variables G1 and G2. Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance.

## 3 Supervised Learning Method for Bank Marketing (Classification Problem)
Nowadays, the bank would be more likely to do marketing for their term deposit. Therefore,
we would like to build a classification model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a
term deposit of the bank or not and also to make the marketing campaigns more efficient.
We plan to build a classification model to better understand the important variables involved
in predicting client subscription to the term deposit. The model can play an vital role in
helping the person-in charge of the marketing campaign better manage their resources by
prioritising higher potential subscription clients.

Task:

Build a Classification model to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). Interpret the model and assess its predictive performance.
